//Ballerina errors can both be returned as yet another return value or be thrown.
//Any Ballerina error type should structurally equivalent to the
//ballerina.lang.errors:Error struct.

//Ballerina best practices encourage developers, to return errors from a
//function/action in an error condition. The caller of the function/action may
//handle errors returns by the function/action if it necessary.

//This example explains how errors can be handled as a return value.
